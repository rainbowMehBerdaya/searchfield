            Without additional information, I am unfortunately not sure how to
            resolve this issue. I am therefore reluctantly going to close this
            bug for now.
            If you still encounter the issue or have more information, please feel free to share it here and I will be happy to reopen the issue.
            Thanks for your contribution.
